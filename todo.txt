// algorithm
-move sorting
    principal variation
    killer moves
    history moves (?)
-generate_children optimization (remember the moves and only change for this.last_move)
-write a wrapper for the first negamax call to catch data such as best move


// heuristic
    -last move instead of entire heuristic for the whole board every time
    -bitset static array instead of unordered_set


// other
    -tweak ordered/unordered set/map. check for collisions & spread across buckets
